# Vanilla UI

Vanilla UI is pretty much what it sounds like - a user interaction library built in plain old javascript. No dependencies, no mucking about.

It aims to be an unobtrusive, object orientated collection of UI elements that can be used independently.

We care about accessibility and making the web available to all.
